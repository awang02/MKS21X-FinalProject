# MKS21X-FinalProject
Team Gecko's Amazing Minesweeper !!!

1/3/18
We began writing up the class Mine and Cell (constructors and headers). However, after reviewing our class structure, decided to make classes Cell and Board.

1/4/18
Geena finished up the default constructors, ironed out the new class format (fields & methods). Allen worked on the hasMine method. We both played around with the terminalDemo and jar file since it'll play a key role in how our project is presented.
